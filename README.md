# ELK_Single_script


This is a single script to install the ELK stack, and all it dependencies. 

Based on Ubuntu 22.04, but should work on other Ubuntu versions. 

Option B - sets up all the dependencies and installs base services and requires a reboot.
Option E - Installs the ELK, the logstash passer and dashboards. This also requires a reboot to start the service on boot up.
Option T - Is option, and installs BigRed and Pentools, and is not for production enviromements.


Under option "E"
You will be asked to select the Repo build, this is based on the CX version of code you are running.
